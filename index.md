## A testing test

I was reading an article on testing the other night and it claimed that 100% code coverage is not really enough.  As I agreed with the most things which were said I thought that I would come up with a fun example to demostrate this.

### The test

Given the following function which returns the largest of 2 numbers,  what tests would you write?


```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DavidBetteridge/DavidBetteridge.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
